# Act Finder

This is a backend code for video-based social media, similar to YouTube, where users can create a portfolio 

by uploading videos. For video storage and performance I have used AWS S3(for storage), CloudFront(as a CDN), and 

Elastic Transcoder(for video optimization for mobile and tablets).

For more details, please check the `Talent-Finder-Backend` directory.

Note: This is an under-going project and I add/improve features whenever I get a free time.
